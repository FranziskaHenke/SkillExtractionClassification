## Classification of Skill Requirements in Job Advertisements using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning

The code in this repository is sorted into two folders:      
Files in the `prepocessing` directory are used to preprocess data and the `classifier` directory includes Jupyter Notebooks which were used to test the different Classifier(-options). 
However, the code is not executable as the data files are not included.

*Note: The numbers in the beginning of the Jupyter Notebook file indicate the chapter the classifier was first used.*
